Combiner
========
Person D — Retrofit Recommendation Engine

Integration point: takes Person A's inefficiency flags, filters the retrofit
catalog to relevant options, runs Persons B/C/D's per-axis scoring functions
on each remaining option, applies the weighted Final Score formula, and
returns a ranked table.

NOTE on the two "building" inputs (documented for the technical report's
assumptions section):
  - Person A's detect_inefficiencies() operates on raw sensor TELEMETRY
    (bldg59 / testbedclean style: rtu_oa_damper_avg, zone temps, hvac_kw,
    etc. -- a DataFrame/Series/dict of hourly readings, or a dataset id).
  - Persons B/C/D's scoring functions operate on a per-building FEATURE
    dict (EESL-style: comfort_impact_score, avoided_co2_tons_yr,
    maintenance_reduction_score, energy_savings_pct, simple_payback_years,
    indoor_temp_c, etc.).
  These are two different views of the same physical building. The combiner
  accepts them separately -- `telemetry_data` for A, `building_features`
  for B/C/D -- rather than forcing one shared schema. If `telemetry_data`
  isn't available (or the caller already has A's flags), pass
  `inefficiency_flags` directly instead and no telemetry is needed.
